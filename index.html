                <h2>How should Dental Practice Consult on WHS</h2>
                <p>Talking about Work Health and Safety (WHS) in a dental practice is very important to make sure everyone has a safe and healthy place to work. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Consultation methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regular Team Meetings:</strong> Safety will be a regular topic at these meetings, so everyone can share their thoughts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Morning Huddles:</strong> These are short talks about specific safety issues that are important for what team members do each day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specific Safety Meetings:</strong> These meetings occur when management or Supervisors need to discuss particular safety worries or when processes change or new equipment is installed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health and Safety Representative (HSR):</strong> HSR to speak for a group of workers (for example, all the dental assistants). This HSR would be part of all talks about safety. 
                        You don't have to have an HSR if the workplace doesn't feel it's needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Employers Need To:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure all dental assistants and other staff can have a say in making decisions that affect their health and safety.</li>
                    <li>Listen to and think about their ideas and concerns about WHS.</li>
                    <li>Work together with you to fix any WHS problems quickly.</li>
                    <li>Ask for your input before making changes that could affect your work. This includes things like getting new dental equipment or materials, changing processes, or changing the layout of the surgery.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The employer should keep records of any decisions made about the health and safety of workers and who was involved in the talks.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="when-to-consult">
                <h2>When do you discuss WHS issues?</h2>
                <p>It's important to talk about safety in different situations to protect the health and safety of the whole team. Discussion should occur when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Finding hazards and analysing the risks:</strong> For example, looking at the risks of handling sharp items, being exposed to radiation from X-ray machines, or possible problems with how you sit or move while working.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thinking about making changes that could affect your health and safety:</strong> This might include changes to how equipment is sterilised, using new dental materials, or changing the patient appointment system in a way that could affect your workload or stress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Making decisions that involve workers or health issues:</strong> Such as creating new rules for infection control, getting rid of waste (including clinical waste), or what to do in an emergency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Checking on the health and safety of workers:</strong> This could involve talking about any health issues that come up because of work or looking at reports of any incidents.</li>
                                    </ul>
                <p>If team members disagree on a safety issue after talking about it, WorkCover NSW or the relevant authority in your state or territory should be contacted. Once the issue is resolved, 
                   a record is kept and everyone is informed about the outcome.</p>
                <p>In short, consultation means sharing important information with you, and all staff, giving you a chance to share your views, raise any safety worries, and help make decisions.</p>
                <p>Remember, <span class="important">Section 48 of the WHS Act</span> states that employers need to consult and share information, and <span class="important">section 49</span> talks about the plan for consultation.</p>

            <div id="meaningful-consultation">
                <h2>Making Sure Talks About WHS are Meaningful</h2>
                <p>It's really important that when we talk about WHS, it's not just something we have to do, but a real conversation. Be ready for questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Did we talk about this specific safety issue?</li>
                    <li>When did we talk about it?</li>
                    <li>Who was involved in the conversation (for example, dental assistants, dentists, practice manager)?</li>
                    <li>How did we talk about it (for example, in a team meeting, one-on-one)?</li>
                    <li>What was the result of the conversation?</li>
                    <li>Where is the written proof of our conversation (for example, meeting notes, safety discussion notes)?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="whs-complaints">
                <h2>How to Make a WHS Complaint in Our Dental Practice</h2>
                <p>If you, as a dental assistant or any other employee, have a question or worry about a safety issue at work, please follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Tell the person in our workplace who is responsible for WHS.</strong> This might be a safety officer, a member of a safety committee (if we have one), or the practice manager.</li>
                    <li><strong>The WHS contact person will officially tell the employer (for example, the head dentist or the owner of the practice) about the issue.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>The employer needs to respond to the complaint in a reasonable time and explain what will be done to fix the problem.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>If the problem isn't fixed after a reasonable time, the WHS Representative(s) (if we have them) can ask a WorkCover NSW inspector to come and check the workplace for safety.</strong> 
                        They can do this without needing to have another meeting with the employer if needed. You can contact WorkCover NSW directly by calling 13 10 50.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><span class="important">Unlawful Dismissal:</span> The WHS Act protects workers. It is against the law to sack, treat unfairly, or discriminate against an employee because they are a Health and Safety Representative (HSR), a committee member, or because they are doing their job under the Act. It is also against the law to sack or treat an employee unfairly for raising a genuine health and safety worry or making a complaint about safety.</p>
